The 80/20 rule states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes in any given situation.</p> <p>In other words, if you focus on 20% of things that will bring 80% of the results you want, you will be much more efficient.</p> <p>Here&#39;s how to apply this rule in learning JavaScript quickly:</p> <p>In JavaScript, there are hundreds of methods and features out there. But in reality, you only need to know a fraction of its methods to get started building meaningful projects. The most common JavaScript features that are worth learning are:</p> <ol> <li>Functions</li> <li>Variables</li> <li>Conditional statements (if/else statements)</li> <li>Objects</li> <li>Arrays</li> <li>DOM event listeners like&nbsp;<code>getElementById</code>,&nbsp;<code>getElementByClass</code>, and&nbsp;<code>addEventListener</code></li> </ol> <p>By focusing on these basic JavaScript methods, you will learn JavaScript faster.</p> <h2>Practice actively</h2> <p>Another way to learn JavaScript fast is to practice actively. Practicing actively means you spend more time writing code than just watching or reading tutorials.</p> <p>Real learning happens when you move your hands and feet in activities like playing football or driving a car. Like these activities, you learn faster when you write JavaScript code on the computer.</p> <p>Try to write code for at least 30 minutes or one hour a day. By writing code regularly and practicing what you&#39;ve learned, you will improve your JavaScript knowledge more quickly.</p> <p>Don&#39;t forget to take breaks on the weekends. Resting is also a crucial part of learning JavaScript. You can learn JavaScript efficiently when you are well-rested, and it helps to improve your sense of focus.</p> <h2>Build Lots of Projects with JavaScript</h2> <p>This one is related to active practice. Building projects is a great way to learn JavaScript faster. The main benefit is that creating these projects &ndash; even simple ones &ndash; will help you solidify the knowledge you gain from the tutorials.</p> <p>You will test yourself to see if you understand JavaScript concepts well enough to actually use them.</p> <p>If you don&#39;t, it&#39;s still a good thing since you will discover what you don&#39;t know yet and use this information to fill the missing gaps in your JavaScript knowledge. All of this will help you to improve your JavaScript skill in the long run.</p> <p>Start by building simple projects that only take you few days to complete and slowly work your way up to advanced projects.&nbsp;<a&nbsp&nbsp;to help you get started building.</p> <h2>Learn how to debug JavaScript errors</h2> <p>The last thing that will help you learn JavaScript more quickly is to&nbsp;learn how to debug JavaScript errors</a>.</p> <p>Learning how to fix the problems you encounter yourself is handy since you will always find bugs when learning JavaScript. Besides, it will make you a resourceful person, which is a great trait to have as a programmer.</p> <p>You&#39;ll need to know how to read the error messages and search for solutions on Google. This debugging approach is simple but good enough to solve most JavaScript problems.</p> <p>The sooner you fix the bugs in your code, the sooner you finish your projects and learn JavaScript faster.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>So, you can learn JavaScript faster if you:</p> <ul> <li>Learn JavaScript methods and features that you will use most of the time.</li> <li>Practice JavaScript by coding for at least 30 minutes to one hour a day and take weekend breaks.</li> <li>Build projects, as it is the best way to solidify your JavaScript knowledge for the long term.</li> <li>Learn how to debug errors so that you can solve your Javascript problems more quickly and keep progressing with your skills.</li> </ul>",
