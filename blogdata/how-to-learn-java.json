  "content": "<h2>History of Java</h2> <p>Sun Microsystems developed the Java programming language in May 1995. It was introduced with the help of Java Development Kit (JDK), which contains a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE contains a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and software tools such as Java application program interfaces (APIs) that help the development of Java applications. The first version of JDK was 1.0 and the latest release of Java Standard Edition is Java SE 10. Developers have defined various configurations of Java in order to fulfill the requirements of multiple platforms such as Java EE for Enterprise Applications and Java ME for Mobile Applications.</p> <p>Java is an object-oriented, cross-platform, powerful and robust programming language with support for security and strong memory management. It also provides support for a multithreading feature with which you can write code that can perform several functions simultaneously. Most developers choose Java as a programming language while creating an application or working on any project because of its amazing features. Java is widely used for developing web applications, software, and web portals as well.</p> <p>The Java source code is saved with .java extension. It is necessary to compile a Java program before its execution. Like other programming languages such as C++ and C, Java also allows you to store data in variables.</p> <h2>Top 30 Java Tutorials, Resources, and Courses</h2> <p>These resources on Java tutorials are described in this article.</p> <h3>1.&nbsp;Codecademy</h3> <p>Codecademy is probably one of the best places to learn Java online.
