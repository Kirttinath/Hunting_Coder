  "content": "<h2><strong>Why Should You Learn Angular?</strong></h2> <p>A beginner who is willing to build a promising future in web development must have suggestions to learn Angular. Also, you may have wondered if it would be a good idea to learn Angular in the first place.</p> <p>To be honest, there is no straightforward answer to this as it completely depends on your requirements. For instance, if you are ready to go through a challenging learning experience, and want to code and manage projects in a highly organized manner, then Angular can be your best pick.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are some of the key features of Angular that often become the reasons why many geeks pick this leading JS framework as their tool of choice for front-end development:</p> <h3><strong>1. Ideal for Developing SPAs (Single-Page Applications)</strong></h3> <p>Building responsive and high-performance single-page applications become easier with Angular. If you don&rsquo;t know, a SPA is a web application that does not require loading multiple HTML pages as all the data and content are injected dynamically in a single HTML page. The content or elements are displayed or removed according to the user&rsquo;s actions on the page.</p> <p>Single-page applications are extremely fast, easy to develop and debug, highly reusable, and offer a better user experience. All these characteristics have made SPAs a popular choice among businesses and developers alike. Angular streamlines the process of developing SPAs, making this framework of great value for developers.</p> <h3><strong>2. Better Management With Components</strong></h3> <p>Angular helps you to streamline the process of web development and also allows sound management of all the application code through components. A component is considered to be the basic building block of an Angular application. Every component has 3 main elements that are:</p> <ol> <li><strong>An HTML Template</strong>: defines the structure of the component that is to be rendered within the app,</li> <li><strong>A CSS Stylesheet:</strong>decides the look and feel of the component, and</li> <li><strong>A TypeScript File:</strong>&nbsp;This contains the code that defines the behavior of the component.</li> </ol> <p>Usually, a component is created for each application to make it easier to keep the whole application well-organized and easy to manage.</p> <h3><strong>3. Quick Production with the Angular CLI</strong></h3> <p>Creating the basic structure of an Angular application and even adding new components and services could have been quite difficult and time-consuming without the Angular CLI.</p> <p>With the Angular command-line interface, creating a new project with all the basic dependencies, files and directories are just a command away. To create a new project, you simply need to use the&nbsp;<strong><em>ng new&nbsp;</em></strong>command followed by the project&#39;s name.</p> <p>Also, you can easily add new components and services to your project by simply executing single-line commands in the Angular CLI. Also, you can build your Angular app, run it on a local server, and do more by using various Angular CLI commands. All this leads to quicker app production and ensures more focus on writing code rather than setting up project files.</p> <h3><strong>4. Animation Support</strong></h3> <p>With Angular, one can build modern apps with a myriad of functionalities. However, there&rsquo;s one more thing that you can add to your apps without any significant challenge, and that is animation. Angular comes with native support for complex animations that allow you to enhance your apps&#39; overall appearance and user experience.</p> <p>The animation API offered by the JS web framework is easy to use and offers a variety of functions. So, you can introduce animations in the various sections of your app that tend to gain users&#39; attention and prompt them to engage with the app in a better way.</p> <h3><strong>5. Cross-Platform Framework</strong></h3> <p>Being a cross-platform framework is one of the most notable reasons for developers to shower Angular with love. It not only lets you create innovative and progressive web applications but also native mobile apps as well as desktop apps.</p> <p>By gaining the knowledge and experience working with Angular, you can create applications for almost all the major platforms, be it Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, or Linux. Surely, you have to take assistance from various other technologies, but Angular will play a pivotal role in developing apps for these platforms right from scratch.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This feature gives you the flexibility to expand your horizons when it comes to&nbsp;app development. Also, all this concludes that Angular is one of the most power-packed and versatile JS frameworks out there.</p> <h3><strong>6. Type Checking Minimizes Coding Errors</strong></h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, the programming language used by Angular is TypeScript. As you know, Angular completely supports JavaScript code as well as all other libraries like&nbsp;. The intention of using TypeScript is to curtail code error to the minimum possible.</p> <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed language that allows you to declare the type of variables and data structures. This allows the detection of errors before the code enters execution. The type of declared variables and data structures are validated in runtime so that no conflicts occur later during code execution.</p> <p>In all, TypeScript allows faster development and, at the same time, reduces the chances of errors in code that come in handy, especially when creating large and complex applications.</p> <p>So, these are some of the most common reasons that make Angular a viable choice for developing top-notch applications. Now, if you have decided to learn the popular JS framework, it&#39;s time to move forward and see how you can actually embark on the journey to become an Angular developer.</p> <h2><strong>Prerequisites for Learning Angular</strong></h2> <p>Angular is widely used for web development, and there are certain requirements that you must meet to learn Angular. By checking off all the prerequisites, you can make sure that you proceed in the right direction and learn the popular web framework in the best possible way. The prerequisites for learning Angular are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sound knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li> <li>The basic idea of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.</li> <li>Basic knowledge of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).</li> <li>Experience working with the command line.</li> <li>Exposure to TypeScript.</li> </ul> <p>The first prerequisite mentioned above, i.e., knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is essential for learning Angular. The other prerequisites can be easily satisfied, and you can learn the basics of MVC, Node.js, npm, and command-line pretty quickly. Also, if you know JavaScript quite well, picking up the fundamentals of TypeScript won&rsquo;t be an issue.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as soon as you meet all the requirements stated above, take a step ahead and choose an IDE to work with Angular.</p> <h2><strong>IDE</strong></h2> <p>As you might already know, the need for a source code editor for writing code and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) comes with it. Also, IDE combines various tools and features, including a debugger, compiler, version control, code completion and refactoring, and syntax highlighting that makes it a complete package for developing, testing, and deploying apps.</p> <p>You can undoubtedly use a dedicated source-code editor like Visual Studio Code or Atom to write Angular code. Still, eventually, you may need to switch to an IDE to ensure faster and efficient development. So, it would be a little better to start your journey with some IDE; else, you can go with a source-code editor too.</p> <p>Below are 3 of the most popular IDEs to use for Angular development:</p> <h3><strong>1.
