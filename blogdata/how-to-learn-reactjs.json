I have also tried to include both free and paid React.js resources for better learning options.</p> <p>Just in case if you have any other useful React websites which teach React development then feel free to suggest.</p> <h3>1.&nbsp;React (Official Website)</h3> <p>Always learning any kind of programming language or framework from the official documentation is a good idea since it was written by the professional who has created or developed that technology so it covers every aspect and almost no mistake in their tutorials.</p> <p>Start by installing the environment like adding the react to your website and start your very first Hello World example then rendering elements and components and much more advanced techniques such as optimizing the performance building your own Hooks and much more you will explore inside the documentation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr /> <h3>2.&nbsp;Udemy</h3> <p>This is one of the best platforms that I suggest people take a look at and learn from their thousands of free online courses in different industries from marketing to business and technology and various&nbsp;programming languages&nbsp;and React is one of them and there are more than three thousand courses only for this topic.</p> <p>When you search Udemy you will find a lot of free React js courses but not all of them are good, some of them are very short and some of them are not up-to-date, but there are still many&nbsp;<em>free React courses</em>&nbsp;that are worth joining like the&nbsp;React JS Frontend Web Development for Beginners&nbsp;which is an up-to-date React course and intended to teach you the basics of Hooks and working with API and some other small features.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This React.js course is not free but one of the biggest courses intended to help you build an amazing and useful React application such as single page application and learning advanced Redux routing deploying the app and more.</p> <hr /> <h3>2.&nbsp;Coursera</h3> <p>Coursera is another great platform that offers online courses, specialization, online degrees, and professional courses created by the top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc, and top universities around the world as well as organizations in different industries such as data science and programming, and React.js.</p> <p>Starting with the best course for React called&nbsp;<strong>Front-End Web Development with React</strong>&nbsp;and will teach you its component and JSX then move to some advanced concepts such as React routing and designing a single page application and the flow architecture and Redux creating client-server communication and how to use the REST API and more.</p> <p>This course or should I say a collection of courses because it&#39;s a Coursera specialization is offered by the University of Hong Kong. Like other Coursera courses, you can audit the course for free, which means you can watch them but you won&#39;t get access to certificates and assessments.</p> <p>If you want a certificate then you can either enroll in the specialization or join the&nbsp;<strong>Coursera Plus</strong>, a subscription plan from Coursera which gives unlimited access to more than 3000+ Coursera resources including Professional certification from Google.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr /> <h3>4.&nbsp;freeCodeCamp</h3> <p>freeCodeCamp is a non-profits organization that has more than six thousand tutorials about technology and programming on their websites and YouTube channels and their graduates have got a good job after graduating and taking the courses offered by them.</p> <p>There are many good resources to learn React.js on freeCodeCamp and&nbsp;Build an Online Store&nbsp;is one of the best projects that you can see to learn how to use React and other technology combining them to create a useful project and deploy it in amazon web service AWS and adding some features such as strip payment to be a complete store created from scratch in one video.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr /> <h3>5.&nbsp;AlterClass</h3> <p>This is another good website to learn Reactjs online.
